Drag a piece onto the square. If a vertex of the piece is close to a vertex of the square, the piece will "snap"
so that the vertices match. Right-clicking on a piece will rotate it by 45Â°.
To complete the puzzle, fill the square completely with the pieces."""),

In addition, clicking on an object shows a bounding box and a number of handles which can be used to transform the shape:
top-left: rotate; middle-right: stretch horizontally; bottom-middle: stretch vertically; bottom-right: enlarge"""),

Drag the polygons around, matching edges as closely as possible. If the angle between the edges is not too great,
